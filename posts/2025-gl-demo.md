## Grocery List Demo

In my last [post](/posts/2025-why-gl), I detailed my newest project, some personal software for tracking my grocery list. Now, there is a live demo available at [gldemo.ryangeary.dev](https://gldemo.ryangeary.dev).

I wanted to make this available as a reference for you, the reader, to be able to see what my little personal software is like without having to launch `gl` on your own.

Take it for a spin! Try typing `chick`, and observe the autocomplete suggestions for both `chicken` and `chicken thighs`, as well as `chickpeas`. Notice that when you select any of those, they are automatically placed in the appropriate category based on the (admiteddly opaque to the user) previous categorizations of these items.
