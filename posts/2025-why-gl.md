## Rolling My Own Grocery List Tool

Last time I wrote about how I am starting a homelab to host a few services I'd
like to make available to me personally or the public. In this post I want to
detail the first service, which is intended for me (and my household), but which
I hope to create a demo version of soon(ish) for public viewing.

## So Why Am I Doing This?

3 reasons: autocomplete, multiplayer, category order.

I've never been able to find a grocery list solution that satisfies all of these
features. So after 7+ years of wanting I'm giving in and making it myself.

## Features I "Need"

Need[^1]

### Autocomplete

Typing is lame. Pressing buttons is cool 😎. I buy the same things from the
grocery store ALL the time. You probably do too. So I shouldn't have to type the
full name of an item every time I add it to the list. It should be offered up
based on a prefix, or perhaps fuzzy matching.

The number of new uniquely named items entered into anyone's grocery list over
time looks like this highly scientific graph:

### Multiplayer

I live with other people, we share food and the shopping burden. We all need to
be able to read and edit the grocery list.

### Categorization and Ordering

I want my grocery list in the order that I will walk through the store. This is
the killer feature that I've always wanted and have never found, presumably
because there is no money in ordering a list, but inherent complexity in the way
every grocery store is different.

## Tools I've Used in the Past

### Google Keep

For a long time, I used Google Keep to make grocery lists. It has simple
checklists, drag and drop to reorder, and will autocomplete an in-progress list
item with previously completed list items.

At the time, I don't think it allowed sharing/multiplayer, although it does seem
to support it now.

It also has no categorization or ordering, so I would manually sort my list or
have a chaotic time in the grocery store.

- [X] Autocomplete 
- [X] Sharing 
- [ ] Categorization/Ordering

### Notion

When the singleplayer (afaik) nature of Google Keep became an issue, I moved to
Notion. It certainly has the ability to let others share and edit the list. It
has no autocomplete, but you could potentially hack together some unseemly
categorization and ordering with it if you wanted.

I had thought when I switched that I might create this categorization within
Notion, but ultimately it was too cumbersome, the UX would be bad, and I didn't
care to.

To get sharing to work still requires convincing others to use a new app but
somehow it being trendy and not Google makes it easier.

## What I'm Building

I'm building a React web app and calling it `gl`. None of my users need to
install anything, and they can make a shortcut on your phone's homescreen to
open it immediately. I'm using React for 3 reasons:
1. like it or not I think it qualifies as boring technology at this point[^2]
1. due to its established and widely used nature `claude` is decent at
generating mostly-working (although certainly not well made) solutions[^3]
1. the [`dnd-kit`](https://dndkit.com/) library for react allowed me to get an acceptably working
drag-and-drop interface for my sorting and categorization

The web app is powered off of a rust backend serving HTTP endpoints and
operating on a SQLite database. The whole stack is hosted on my [homelab](/posts/2025-homelab-1).

The app includes a simplistic command line interface. Inputing any text is
considered a grocery list item, added when you hit Enter. The exception is if
the input starts with `/`, in which case it becomes a command. So far I have
commands for `/help` and a series of Category-manipulation commands.

All of these commands have autosuggestions based on previous grocery items or
whatever data is relevant to the command in question.

Next we have the grocery list. Populated by the inputs to the CLI component. It
includes drag-and-drop to reorder and recategorize, checkboxes, and delete `X`s.
Pretty straightforward all around.

## The Workflow

My goal here is to 
1. define the areas (and order of them) in my grocery store,
2. automatically categorize a grocery list item into an area, if possible, based
   on past item categorization,
3. if that's not possible, mark it uncategorized and let the user categorize it
   themselves (with the drag-and-drop interface), which leads to future
   auto-categorization.

This doesn't mean that every item I pick up will be the first remaining item in
the list, but it does mean that I only have to scan the "produce" section when
I'm in "produce" and the "dairy" section when I'm in "dairy", which is good
enough for me.

There could be an interesting ML project here for the future, auto-ordering
within categories based on previous check-off order.

The manual categorization over time again looks like this graph:

## Demo

This is still very much in development and not yet ready for a polished demo,
but you are welcome to boot it yourself and try it out. Just checkout
[my homelab](https://github.com/theryangeary/homelab) and use `npm run dev` and
`cargo run` from the `gl/ts` and `gl/rust` directories respectively.

I would like to create a demo version of the site as well for a more accessible
and durable demo. I'm wary of making a multiplayer demo because that would
require some content moderation. I'm considering either a modified frontend that
uses a browser-side SQLite database, or an ephemeral backend database per
browser. 

I'm leaning toward the ephemeral backend database as it wouldn't require
rewriting my database interface layer to run in the browser, but I'm still
brainstorming in this area.

Either option requires further work beyond the scope of simply making the app
and hosting it, but it's nice to be able to demo publicly.

## Status

At time of publication, `gl` is basically functional but could use some polish.
However it is usable, so if this is of interest feel free to host it yourself
and try it out.

## Footnotes

[^1]: Need is a strong word. Realistically I don't "need" any features or even a
    grocery list at all. These are conveniences I want, not needs.
[^2]: Not as boring as SQLite certainly, but I feel confident I won't get burned
    using React compared to the time I made a web app for contract and chose to
    use Angular shortly after the switch from AngularJS to Angular (a huge,
    breaking rewrite) when all the resources I could find still used the older
    version.
[^3]: Claude acts very much like a junior dev, making something horribly hacky
    but seems to work on the surface. For this project I used claude sparingly,
    compared to my previous project `pathfinder`. I'm planning to write
    something up about my experience using claude for `pathfinder` soon.
